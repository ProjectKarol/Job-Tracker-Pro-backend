### Migration

___

To generate a new migration you can simply call:

```bash
npm run migration:generate -- ./src/migration/<NAME_OF_NEW_MIGRATION>
```

This will create a new migration file in `./src/migration/` folder.
After that you can run `migration:run` script to update the database:

```bash
npm run migration:run
```
